  abstract={Ultracold atoms in periodical-driven optical lattices enable us to investigate novel band structures and explore the topology of the bands. In this work, we investigate the impact of the ramping process of the driving signal and propose a simple but effective method to realize desired asymmetric population in momentum distribution by controlling the initial phase of the driving signal. A quasi-momentum oscillation along the shaking direction in the frame of reference co-moving with the lattice is formed, causing the formation of the mix of ground energy band and first excited band in laboratory frame, within the regime that the driving frequency is far less than the coupling frequency between ground band and higher energy bands. This method avoids the construction of intricate lattices or complex control sequence. With a triangular lattice, we experimentally investigate the influence of the initial phase, frequency, amplitude of the driving signal on the population difference and observe good agreement with our theoretical model. This provides guidance on how to load a driving signal in driven optical lattice experiment and also potentially supplies a useful tool to form a qubit that can be used in quantum computation.},

  title = {Evidence of Potts-Nematic Superfluidity in a Hexagonal sp2 Optical Lattice},
  author = {Jin, Shengjie and Zhang, Wenjun and Guo, Xinxin and Chen, Xuzong and Zhou, Xiaoji and Li, Xiaopeng},
  abstract = {As in between liquid and crystal phases lies a nematic liquid crystal, which breaks rotation with preservation of translation symmetry, there is a nematic superfluid phase bridging a superfluid and a supersolid. The nematic order also emerges in interacting electrons and has been found to largely intertwine with multiorbital correlation in high-temperature superconductivity, where Ising nematicity arises from a four-fold rotation symmetry C4 broken down to C2. Here, we report an observation of a three-state (Z3) quantum nematic order, dubbed “Potts-nematicity”, in a system of cold atoms loaded in an excited band of a hexagonal optical lattice described by an sp2-orbital hybridized model. This Potts-nematic quantum state spontaneously breaks a three-fold rotation symmetry of the lattice, qualitatively distinct from the Ising nematicity. Our field theory analysis shows that the Potts-nematic order is stabilized by intricate renormalization effects enabled by strong interorbital mixing present in the hexagonal lattice. This discovery paves a way to investigate quantum vestigial orders in multiorbital atomic superfluids.},

  title = {Implementation of a Double-Path Multimode Interferometer Using a Spinor {{Bose-Einstein}} Condensate},
  author = {Tang, Pengju and Dong, Xiangyu and Zhang, Wenjun and Li, Yunhong and Chen, Xuzong and Zhou, Xiaoji},
  abstract = {We realize a double-path multimode matter wave interferometer with spinor Bose-Einstein condensate and observe clear spatial interference fringes as well as a periodic change of the visibility in the time domain, which we refer to as the time domain interference and which is different from the traditional double-path interferometer. By changing the relative phase of the two paths, we find that the spatial fringes first lose coherence and recover. As the number of modes increases, the time domain interference signal with the narrower peaks is observed, which is beneficial to the improvement of the resolution of the phase measurement. We also investigated the influence of initial phase configuration and phase evolution rate between different modes in the two paths. With enhanced resolution, the sensitivity of interferometric measurements of physical observables can also be improved by properly assigning measurable quantities to the relative phase between two paths.},
