Welcome to Wenjun Zhang's homepage! I am a graduate student at Physics Department, Tsinghua University. My research interests include atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics and quantum simulation. Advised by Prof. Wenlan Chen, I'm excited to investigate the physics of quantum many-body systems with long-range interactions by using Rydberg atom arrays.
